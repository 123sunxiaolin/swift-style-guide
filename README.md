#### Prefer implicit getters on read-only properties and subscripts

When possible, omit the `get` keyword on read-only computed properties and
read-only subscripts.

So, write these:

```swift
var myGreatProperty: Int {
	return 4
}

subscript(index: Int) -> T {
    return objects[index]
}
```

… not these:

```swift
var myGreatProperty: Int {
	get {
		return 4
	}
}

subscript(index: Int) -> T {
    get {
        return objects[index]
    }
}
```

_Rationale:_ The intent and meaning of the first version is clear, and results in less code.

#### Always specify access control explicitly for top-level definitions

Top-level functions, types, and variables should always have explicit access control specifiers:

```swift
public var whoopsGlobalState: Int
internal struct TheFez {}
private func doTheThings(things: [Thing]) {}
```

However, definitions within those can leave access control implicit, where appropriate:

```swift
internal struct TheFez {
	var owner: Person = Joshaber()
}
```

_Rationale:_ It's rarely appropriate for top-level definitions to be specifically `internal`, and being explicit ensures that careful thought goes into that decision. Within a definition, reusing the same access control specifier is just duplicative, and the default is usually reasonable.

#### Only explicitly refer to `self` when required

When accessing properties or methods on `self`, leave the reference to `self` implicit by default:

```swift
private class History {
	var events: [Event]

	func rewrite() {
		events = []
	}
}
```

Only include the explicit keyword when required by the language—for example, in a closure, or when parameter names conflict:

```swift
extension History {
	init(events: [Event]) {
		self.events = events
	}

	var whenVictorious: () -> () {
		return {
			self.rewrite()
		}
	}
}
```

_Rationale:_ This makes the capturing semantics of `self` stand out more in closures, and avoids verbosity elsewhere.
